This is a simple Snake game implemented in TypeScript. It's a classic arcade game where you control a snake, guiding it to eat food and grow longer while avoiding traps and collisions with itself.

**Please Note:** This game is optimized for desktop play and may not work well on mobile devices.

### :snake: HOW TO PLAY

Use the arrow keys (Up/W, Down/S, Left/A, Right/D) to control the snake's direction.
Your goal is to eat the food (apple) to grow longer.
Avoid running into the traps(fire) or the snake's own body.
The game ends when you hit the fire or yourself.
Your score is updated every time you eat an apple!
Happy slithering!
